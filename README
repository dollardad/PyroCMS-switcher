Switcher is a simple plugin for PyroCMS version 2+

It allows you to allocate a number of alternative css classes to an element that is running within a block of code
for example the blog module

Installation as per any other plugin for PyroCMS.

Syntax

{{ switcher:class_row class="red|blue|white" }}

Note:
That it uses the pipe key between each class.
No limit to the number of classes.

Example:
Within the blog Module, on the page that dislays a list of teasers

{{ blog:posts limit="5" order-by="title" order-dir="desc" url="news" }}
<!-- Use switcher here -->
<div class="{{ switcher:class_row class="red|blue|white" }}">

// Now the rest of your code/markup


</div>
{{/blog:posts}}
